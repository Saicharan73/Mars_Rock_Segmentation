# Mars_Rock_Segmentation
"The scientists exploring the solar system planets outside earth need to have a good idea of the terrain of the planet surface for various predictions of surface formation and other research on planet elements. 
This data is also needed by rovers on planets that can travel several kilometers in each day and also should not collide with objects in their path. Hence, they have to depend on the images/videos their automated devices can take and predict the rocks and obstacles in their way."
The projectâ€™s objective is to segment and label the structure of the rock. The rocks may be of similar colour as the background soil, and thus segmentation is challenging. Convolutional Neural Networks could be used to segment the images using Deep Learning![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99131677/230605241-3fc7087c-d5cb-40b5-bfb1-6e52621990a2.png)
